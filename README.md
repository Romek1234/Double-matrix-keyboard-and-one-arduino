Double matrix keyboard and one arduino transmitting on different MIDI channel


Thanks Pieter P - tttapa  https://github.com/tttapa


One 8x4 matrix keyboard works very well. I expanded with 4 more buttons that would work on another midi channel - and the extended one does not work! Would someone help me?
